# Analysis of different city types for PyBer
## Overview of the Analysis
I was tasked with taking a look at ride share data provided by PyBer to determine any noticeable trends. To do this, I needed to
clean up the data to be properly displayed in a line graph that showed Urban, Rural, and Suburban fares throughout several months. I also
collected the information to look at the number of total rides per city type, the total drivers, the average far per ride, and the average
fare per driver.
## Results of the Analysis
### Urban, Rural, and Suburban Data
After collecting the data on the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver, several
trends were noticeable. The Urban cities had the largest total of rides of the three city types at 1625, followed by Suburban with 625 rides, and Rural with 125 rides. This trend also followed to total drivers, with Urban cities having the largest number with 2405, then
Suburban with 490, followed by Rural with 78. Although Urban cities also had the highest amount of total fares at $39,854.38, the average fare per ride and the average fare per driver were the lowest, at $24.53 and $16.57 respectively. Based on this information, it appears
that there is a correlation between total ride/driver amount and average fare per ride/per driver. Attached below is a table of this data.
